## My process

### Built with

This project was built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5:** Utilized semantic HTML markup to structure the content of the FAQ accordion.

- **CSS3:** Employed CSS for styling the components, including the use of flexbox, transitions, and media queries for responsive design.

- **JavaScript:** Implemented interactive features such as the accordion functionality using vanilla JavaScript. Managed DOM manipulation and event handling to create a dynamic user experience.

- **Frontend Mentor:** Leveraged the design provided by Frontend Mentor as a starting point, contributing to the real-world design challenges aspect of the project.

These technologies were chosen to create a responsive, visually appealing, and interactive FAQ accordion that meets the project requirements.


### What I learned

In the process of completing this FAQ accordion project, I gained valuable insights and skills:

- **Accordion Functionality:** Implemented a responsive accordion feature using JavaScript to toggle the display of answers when questions are clicked. This enhanced my understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling.

- **CSS Styling Techniques:** Explored and applied CSS styling techniques such as flexbox, transitions, and hover effects to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface. The use of CSS custom properties improved maintainability.

- **Responsive Design:** Ensured a seamless user experience across different devices by incorporating a responsive design approach. Utilized media queries to adapt the layout for smaller screens.

- **Collaboration with Frontend Mentor:** Engaged with the Frontend Mentor community by working on a challenge, which provided exposure to real-world design problems and solutions. It also allowed me to receive feedback and learn from others.

- **Documentation:** Practiced documenting my code and project. This README file serves as a guide for others to understand the project, its features, and my thought process.

These learnings have contributed to my growth as a frontend developer, and I plan to apply these skills in future projects to create more interactive and visually appealing web applications.

### Continued development

While completing this FAQ accordion project, I identified areas for improvement and future development:

- **Accessibility Features:** Enhance accessibility by ensuring the accordion is fully navigable using keyboard controls. Implement ARIA attributes and focus management to improve the experience for users with disabilities.

- **Animations:** Introduce subtle animations to create a smoother and more visually appealing transition when expanding or collapsing accordion items. This could include fade-ins, slide effects, or other animations to improve the overall user experience.

- **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing across various browsers and devices to ensure consistent functionality and styling. Address any cross-browser compatibility issues and fine-tune the design for different screen sizes.

- **Code Refactoring:** Review and refactor the codebase for improved readability and maintainability. Consider breaking down the JavaScript functions into smaller, reusable modules and optimizing CSS styles for better organization.

- **Mobile Optimization:** Further optimize the design for mobile devices, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience on smaller screens. Test and refine the layout to accommodate different screen sizes and resolutions effectively.

- **Community Feedback:** Seek feedback from the Frontend Mentor community or other developers to gather insights and suggestions for improvement. Incorporate constructive feedback to refine both the functionality and design of the FAQ accordion.

- **Additional Features:** Explore the possibility of adding extra features to enhance user engagement, such as search functionality, sorting options, or the ability to bookmark favorite questions.

These focus areas represent my plans for the project's continued development, and I aim to iterate on the current implementation to create a more polished and feature-rich FAQ accordion

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to extend my gratitude to Frontend Mentor for providing a platform with real-world challenges that allowed me to apply and improve my front-end development skills.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

Want some support on the challenge? [Join our community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) and ask questions in the **#help** channel.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. You can choose to either link to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts yourself. Note that we've removed the static font files for the font weights that aren't needed for this project.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. [Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).

## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.
